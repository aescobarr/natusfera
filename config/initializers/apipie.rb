    The iNat API is a set of REST endpoints that can be used to read data from
    iNat and write data back on the behalf of users. Data can be retrieved in
    different formats by appending  <code>.[format]</code> to the endpoint, e.g.
    <code>/observations.json</code> to retrieve observations as JSON. Read-only endpoints
    generally do not require authentication, but if you want to access data
    like unobscured coordinates on behalf of users or write data to iNat, you
    will need to make authenticated requests (see http://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference#auth).
