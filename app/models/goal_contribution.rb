  # This doesn't seem to work in self.count calls, and so may be useless.

  # Accepts a start time and optional end time.  If no end time is provided,
  # assumes Time.now.  Note: this also works with Rails' additional Date
  # methods.
  #
  # Allows for complex date queries like so:
  # GoalContribution.contributed_to(1).within(7.days.ago).find(:all)
  # GoalContribution.contributed_to(1).within(1.hour.ago).find(:all)
  # GoalContribution.contributed_to(1).within(1.year.ago).find(:all)
  #
  # Using the Date methods:
  # GoalContribution.contributed_to(1).within(Date.today).find(:all)
  # GoalContribution.contributed_to(1).within(Date.yesterday).find(:all)
