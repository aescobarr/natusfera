  # Right now this represents a simple model whereby each object is tested
  # against each rule.  It might make more sense to only test each object
  # against the rules which share the same class.  Otherwise each rule
  # must handle all types of objects for them to be reusable.
  #
  # For example, we test an observation against 2 rules, one in the 
  # Observation class that sees if the observation was recorded before a
  # certain date, an another in the Taxon class that sees if a species
  # is found in a taxon. The rule within the Taxon class might expect to be
  # passed a Taxon object, but will receive an Observation object.  This
  # means that either the method will return false, the method should return
  # nothing (nil) or the method should handle Observation objects as well as
  # Taxon objects.  For now I think we should let this play out and keep an
  # eye on it.
